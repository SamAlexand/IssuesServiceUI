# IssuesUI

The beginnings of a simple Single Page Application for a Defect Tracking system written with Backbone.JS and using Bootstrap for styling. It depends upon and calls the IssuesService REST service available in project https://github.com/SamAlexand/IssuesService .

This application is part of my 2015 IBM ConnectED presentation entitled AD203: "Building Digital Experiences in the Cloud with BlueMix and WebSphere Portal Tools"  The applcation is designed so that it runs inside the IBM Script Portlet ( https://greenhouse.lotus.com/plugins/plugincatalog.nsf/assetDetails.xsp?action=editDocument&documentId=DDB5C467D991413285257C67002476E0 )
